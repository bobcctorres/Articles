Abstract: The purpose of this paper was to evaluate the
literature on a predictive analysis in time series, to examine, to compare known types of analysis and to explore the
proposition of a practical method to carry out such analysis on foreign exchange market data (FOREX) with the
support of neural networks over the aim of constructing
an algorithm or forecasting process capable of supporting
corporate decision making regarding remittance of foreign
exchange or purchase and sale of foreign currency using as
a derivative example the Eurodollar pair.

The objective is to demonstrate the validity of models
built on neural networks for this purpose and its equivalence
with other predictive models most used in the contemporary
literature and for that, this paper uses hypothesis construction by comparing models through statistical analysis of
variance (ANOVA). The analysis considers three neural
networks with a training algorithm based on Multilayer Perceptron and a comparative baseline algorithm widely used
in machine learning, the Random Forest. The study concludes by quantitatively and statistically, through ANOVA
and Tukeyâ€™s Test, asserting the equivalence of neural networks against other methods in the predictive analysis of
financial-economic time series, using as a base for testing
the FOREX data between 2013 and 2016.

Keywords: Neural network, FOREX, classification.
